    "One of the boldest and oldest openings: White offers a pawn on the very " +
    "second move to blow open the f-file and grab the centre. It is romantic, " +

    "double-edged, it rewards courage and sharp calculation.",

    "Tempt Black into ...exf4, then build a big pawn centre and open the f-file " +

    "connect a rook to the f-file, and attack the black king before Black untangles the " +
    "kingside (Black's ...g5 holds the pawn but loosens his king). Initiative is the " +

      "The open f-file, a big centre with d4, and a fast attack on f7 and the black king.",

    explanation:
      "White sacrifices the f-pawn for activity, not safety — White's own king is, if anything, the more exposed one. The compensation is concrete: the half-open f-file for the rook, a pawn duo on d4/e4, and a developmental head start to throw at f7 before Black consolidates the extra pawn.",
