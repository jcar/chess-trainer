    "The most symmetrical of the open games: both sides simply bring out all " +
    "four knights to their best squares before doing anything else. It is calm, " +
    "principled, and very hard to go wrong with — a model lesson in classical " +
    "development. White is not chasing a knockout, just a small, durable edge " +
    "from sound piece play.",
  whitePlan:
    "Complete healthy development, add the king's bishop (usually to b5 or via " +
    "the centre with d4), castle, and convert a tiny lead in space and " +
    "coordination into a lasting positional pull.",
  blackPlan:
    "Match White's development move for move, keep the position solid and " +
    "symmetrical, and look to free the game with a timely ...d5 break once the " +
    "pieces are out.",
  middlegamePlan:
    "The Four Knights is about a one-tempo edge in a symmetrical position. Don't force " +
    "matters — complete development (Bb5 or d4, O-O, d3), then break the symmetry in your " +
    "favour: a well-timed Nd5 outpost, Bxc6 to inflict doubled pawns, or the central d4 " +
    "break. Pressure e5, claim the half-open lines that open after trades, and convert the " +
    "small initiative patiently rather than hunting a knockout.",

    question: "In a dead-symmetrical Four Knights, where does White's small advantage come from?",
    options: [
      "The extra tempo of moving first — use it to break the symmetry first (Nd5, Bxc6, or d4).",
      "A direct attack on the f7-square.",
      "Winning the e5-pawn outright.",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Symmetry favours the player to move — White is effectively one tempo ahead. The plan isn't a quick attack or a pawn grab; it's to be the first to change the structure on good terms: jump a knight into d5, double Black's pawns with Bxc6, or strike with d4. Whoever breaks the symmetry well gets the pull.",
