    explanation:
      "Both defences prop up d5, but the QGD's ...e6 shuts in the c8-bishop. The Slav plays ...c6 instead, so that bishop can come out to f5 or g4 first; only then ...e6. Same rock-solid structure, but with Black's problem piece solved — that's why it's a world-champion favourite.",
