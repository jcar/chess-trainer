    "A fighting, asymmetrical defence for players who hate dull positions. " +
    "Black willingly hands White more space in the centre, accepting a " +
    "cramped but spring-loaded position. In return Black gets a queenside pawn " +

  middlegamePlan:
    "The Benoni is a deliberate imbalance: you give White central space for a queenside pawn " +
    "majority, a monster g7-bishop, and the half-open e-file. The plan is dynamite, not " +
    "defence — fianchetto, castle, then roll the majority with ...a6 and ...b5 (the thematic " +
    "break), put rooks on the b- and e-files, and pressure e4. Keep the pieces active around " +
    "the d6/c5 chain. White's danger is a central e4–e5 push or an f4 storm; blunt it with " +
    "...Re8 and ...Na6–c7, then counterpunch on the queenside where you're stronger.",

    explanation:
      "The Benoni trades space for dynamism. Black's assets are all on the queenside and the long diagonal: a 3-vs-2 majority that rolls with ...a6/...b5, the fianchettoed bishop hitting d4, and rooks on the open b- and e-files. The cramp is the price; the queenside break is the payoff.",
