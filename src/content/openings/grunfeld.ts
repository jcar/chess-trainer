    "A bold, hypermodern answer to 1.d4. Instead of occupying the centre, " +
    "Black invites White to build a broad pawn front — and then sets out to " +
    "tear it down. The fianchettoed bishop on g7 rakes the long diagonal while " +
    "...c5 and piece pressure pour onto the centre. It is dynamic, double-edged " +
    "chess where Black trades space for activity.",
  whitePlan:
    "Accept the invitation: grab the centre with pawns on d4 and e4, develop " +
    "behind them, and try to prove the space advantage by keeping the pawns " +
    "rolling and the centre intact.",

    "Let White overextend, then strike with ...c5 and the g7-bishop down the " +
    "long diagonal, hitting d4 and the queenside until White's proud centre " +

  middlegamePlan:
    "The Grünfeld is the Alekhine's big brother: invite White's d4/e4 centre, then tear it " +
    "down. The g7-bishop rakes the long diagonal, and ...c5 (backed by ...Nc6, ...Qa5, " +
    "...Bg4 and ...Rd8) hammers d4 and White's pawns. In the Exchange line, target the " +
    "c3-pawn White creates — pile up until the proud centre cracks. Don't sit still: the " +
    "moment White's pawns advance, attack them, because a centre you can't pressure is a " +
    "centre that simply wins.",

    question: "White builds a big d4/e4 pawn centre in the Grünfeld. How should Black treat it?",

      "As a target — attack it at once with ...c5, the g7-bishop and piece pressure.",

    explanation:
      "The Grünfeld is hypermodern to its core: a pawn centre is only strong if it can't be hit. Black hands White the centre, then assaults it — ...c5 and ...Bg7 strike d4, ...Nc6/...Qa5/...Rd8 pile on, and in the Exchange the doubled c3-pawn becomes a chronic target. Activity, not occupation.",
