    "The classical, rock-solid way to meet 1.d4. Instead of grabbing the " +
    "offered c4-pawn, Black props up the d5-pawn with ...e6 and builds a " +
    "sturdy wall in the centre. The position is hard to crack: Black unravels " +
    "patiently, completes development, and only then looks for activity. It has " +
    "been a dependable choice at the very highest level for over a century.",

    "Develop with Nc3, Bg5 and e3, keep the small space edge the c4/d4 pawns " +

    "for a freeing break — ...c5, or ...dxc4 followed by ...c5/...e5. Watch for White's " +
    "minority attack (b4–b5, trading to leave you a weak c6-pawn) and meet it by keeping " +
    "your structure compact and finding a ...c5 or ...e5 counter-break before the c6-pawn " +
