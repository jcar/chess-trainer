    "One of the most positionally clear gambits in chess. Black offers the " +
    "b-pawn not for a quick attack but for permanent, low-risk pressure: the " +
    "a- and b-files swing open, and Black's rooks and fianchettoed bishop bear " +
    "down on White's queenside for the rest of the game. Even in endgames the " +
    "pressure lingers, which makes it remarkably safe for a gambit.",

      "Permanent pressure on the open a- and b-files and the long diagonal — lasting even into endgames.",

    explanation:
      "Unlike most gambits, the Benko isn't about a quick attack — it's about lasting structural pressure. The half-open a- and b-files plus the g7-bishop bear down on White's queenside for the entire game, and uniquely the compensation persists into the endgame, which is why it's so safe to play a pawn down.",
