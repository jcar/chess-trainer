      "So the light-squared bishop gets OUTSIDE the pawn chain and is never bad.",

    explanation:
      "This is the single idea that defines the Caro-Kann. In the French, ...e6 traps the light bishop behind its own pawns. The Caro plays ...c6 and gets that bishop OUT to f5/g6 first — only then ...e6. Same solidity as the French, but no bad bishop.",
