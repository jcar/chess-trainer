    "The most direct answer to 1.e4: Black challenges the king's pawn on the " +
    "very first move. After the centre is exchanged, the queen usually comes " +
    "out early to recapture, which breaks a beginner's rule — but here it is " +
    "well-timed, because the queen retreats to safety while Black completes " +
    "fast, harmonious development.",
  whitePlan:
    "Gain time by harassing Black's early queen with natural developing moves " +
    "like Nc3 and d4, build a broad pawn centre, and use the lead in " +
    "development to press for a lasting space advantage.",
  blackPlan:
    "Recapture on d5, tuck the queen onto a safe square, and develop quickly " +
    "and simply with ...Nf6, ...c6, ...Bf5 and a kingside castle, reaching a " +
    "solid, easy-to-play position with no weaknesses.",
  middlegamePlan:
    "The Scandinavian is solid and scheme-like — you build the same healthy setup almost " +
    "every game. After tucking the queen away, play ...Nf6, then ...c6 (vital: it gives the " +
    "queen a permanent c7 bolt-hole and stops Nb5 ideas), get the light bishop OUT with " +
    "...Bf5 or ...Bg4 before ...e6 locks it in, then ...e6, ...Bd6 or ...Be7, ...O-O, " +
    "...Nbd7. You have no weaknesses; free yourself later with ...c5 or ...e5 and head for a " +
    "comfortable middlegame or endgame. The one rule: never leave the queen where a knight " +
    "or bishop hits it with real tempo.",

    explanation:
      "White does win a tempo or two chasing the queen — but only a couple, and Black's structure is so sound that it's a fair trade. The key is ...c6: it hands the queen a safe c7 retreat and kills Nb5 tricks, so after that the queen is never harassed with real tempo again.",
