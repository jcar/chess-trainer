    "An anti-Sicilian for players who'd rather build a big centre than memorize " +
    "razor-sharp main lines. With 2.c3 White prepares d2–d4 fully supported, " +

    "where White's freer development and central space give an easy game.",
  whitePlan:
    "Play c3 and d4 to occupy the centre, develop quickly (Nf3, Bishops out, " +

    "The Alapin plays for a healthy big centre and, very often, an isolated queen's pawn " +
    "(IQP) after the d-file opens. Embrace the IQP as a dynamic asset, not a weakness: use " +
    "the half-open e-file, plant a knight on e5, aim both bishops at the kingside (Bd3/Bc2 " +
    "plus Bg5), and play for the d4–d5 break or a direct attack while Black is tied to " +
    "blockading. Press in the middlegame — if many pieces come off, the isolated pawn can " +
    "become a target, so make your space and activity count first.",

      "An open, isolated-queen-pawn position where White's space and active pieces attack.",

    explanation:
      "2.c3 prepares a fully supported d4. When the centre opens, White usually accepts an isolated d-pawn in return for free development, central space, and the e5-outpost — a classic IQP attacking position. The plan is dynamic pressure (and often a kingside attack), not a quiet manoeuvre or a quick win.",
