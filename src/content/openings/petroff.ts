    "Instead of defending the e5-pawn, Black immediately counterattacks White's " +
    "e4-pawn with 2...Nf6 — meeting a threat with a threat. The result is " +
    "famously solid and symmetrical, a favourite of players who want a reliable, " +
    "low-risk answer to 1.e4. It trades early fireworks for clarity and balance.",
  whitePlan:
    "Grab the e5-pawn, then retreat the knight in good order; build a small " +
    "central edge with d4 and natural development, and try to make Black's " +
    "symmetry slightly passive.",

    "The Petroff is about harmony and zero weaknesses. After you regain the pawn with " +
    "...Nxe4, don't cling to that knight — be ready to retreat it (...Nf6/...Nd6) the moment " +
    "it's challenged. Develop everything to natural squares (...Be7 or ...Bd6, ...O-O, " +
    "...Nc6, an active ...Bf5 or ...Bg4), contest the open e-file with a rook, and steer " +
    "toward a sound, symmetrical position where White's first-move edge simply fizzles. " +
    "Accuracy and patience, not counterattack, win Petroff games.",

    question: "After 3.Nxe5, why does Black play 3...d6 first instead of grabbing 3...Nxe4 at once?",
    options: [
      "3...Nxe4?? walks into 4.Qe2! — the knight is loose and 4...Nf6?? 5.Nc6+ even wins the queen.",
      "To open the light-squared bishop's diagonal before recapturing.",
      "To prepare quick queenside castling.",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "The signature Petroff trap. Recapturing immediately with 3...Nxe4?? loses, because 4.Qe2 pins/skewers along the e-file and threatens the knight; if Black unpins with 4...Nf6?? then 5.Nc6+ forks king and queen. So Black kicks the e5-knight first with 3...d6, and only then plays ...Nxe4 safely.",
