    "One of the oldest openings, and the friendliest introduction to 1.e4 e5. " +
    "White develops naturally and points the light-squared bishop straight at " +
    "f7 — the square only the king defends. It can be played very quietly " +
    "(maneuvering for a slow build-up) or sharply (with an early d4 break), so " +
    "it scales with your taste while always teaching sound development.",
  whitePlan:
    "Develop quickly, castle, and aim the bishop at f7. Choose between the " +
    "restrained d3 set-up (the 'Giuoco Pianissimo', a slow maneuvering game) " +
    "or the classical c3 + d4 break to seize a big pawn centre.",
  blackPlan:
    "Mirror White's healthy development with ...Bc5 and ...Nf6, keep e5 " +
    "defended, castle, and be ready to hit back in the centre with ...d5 once " +
    "pieces are out.",
  middlegamePlan:
    "In the quiet Giuoco Pianissimo, both sides are castled and nothing is forced — " +
    "so improve your pieces and prepare a break. White's signature plan is to reroute " +
    "the b1-knight: Nbd2–f1–g3 (eyeing f5) or Nbd2–f1–e3 (eyeing d5/f5), then play for " +
    "d4 or a kingside expansion with h3 and g4. Black's freeing idea is ...d5 (often " +
    "prepared by ...a6, ...Ba7, ...Re8); if you let it land for free, your edge " +
    "evaporates. So: knight to g3/e3, restrain ...d5, and pick the wing where you're better.",

      "It's a quiet Giuoco Pianissimo and nothing is forced. What's White's typical plan with the b1-knight?",

      "Reroute it Nbd2–f1–g3 (or e3) toward the kingside / d5.",

    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "The b1-knight has no good square on the queenside, so the standard maneuver is Nbd2–f1–g3 (heading for f5) or Nbd2–f1–e3 (eyeing d5 and f5). It joins a kingside build-up and helps restrain Black's ...d5 break — a far better use than trading or leaving it passive.",
